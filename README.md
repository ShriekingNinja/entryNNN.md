### 🧩 Berkano Guidance 
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. Present tense, testable steps.*

| Overload at reply start              | **Enable** a five-line first reply and apply PRUNE| PRUNE checklist link; editor setting        | Ask before expanding scope                         |
| Scope creep causes stress            | **Add** a consent line before offering options    | “Want alternatives? yes/no” snippet         | Stop at asked scope unless user opts in            |
| Web claim cited in public post       | **Make** a report and **Publish** with “H24: chain passed” note | Report URL; source links             | Treat as testimony unless verified                 |
| Contradictions repeat across threads | **Create** a contradiction ledger and link fossils| Ledger doc URL; prior ENTRY/BLOCK links     | Append-only; no edits to locked entries            |
